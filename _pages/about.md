## What's up gamers

I'm sloraris, a tech enthusiast by day, and by night... well, still a tech enthusiast but with significantly more caffeine. I'm currently mastering the art of balancing an Information Systems degree with an uncanny ability to quote "Star Wars" in every life situation. When I'm not knee-deep in coding or cybersecurity, you can find me orchestrating epic builds in the world of minecraft or trying to convince my roommates that my latest Docker container is, in fact, the coolest thing ever.

Legend has it that I was born with a keyboard in one hand and a mouse in the other, and I haven't slowed down since. My apartment in is a shrine to all things tech, with a special homage to my black Mazda 3 - the trusty steed that carries me on my quests for knowledge (and occasionally, pizza).

As a proud owner of an iPhone 15 Pro, Apple Watch Ultra, MacBook Air M2, and an iPad Air, I'm living proof that one can never have too many Apple products. Or too many monitors, but that's a story for another day.

In my quest to become a cybersecurity wizard, I've learned two things: never underestimate the power of a strong password, and always have a backup plan for when your roommates accidentally unplug your server.

So, welcome to my digital domain! Grab a seat, enjoy the tech talk, and remember - in the words of Master Yoda, "Do or do not, there is no try." (But seriously, let's try to keep the server running this time).
